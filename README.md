# Naca0012_PCE


This repository contains the following files:

Java Template File: Java.jinja2

Star-CCM+ Simulation File: .sim

Python Script for Uncertainty Evaluation: Python_script.py



Setup Instructions

Before running the code, ensure that you have set the appropriate file permissions and updated all necessary file paths for the simulations.

Code Structure

The code is divided into three main sections:

Directory Management: Handles the organization and management of the repository.

Simulation Tools Setup: Establishes the tools required for running the simulations.

Post-Processing: Focuses on analyzing and processing the simulation results.


Common Issues
A common issue is Star-CCM+ failing to run the simulations due to incorrect paths. To troubleshoot, run a single simulation using the Windows shell to verify that the paths are correctly configured.
